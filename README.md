In this fun workshop, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot to enhance a node-based Calculator, with little to no coding experience required.

The project contains a simple node.js application that exposes REST APIs to perform arithmetic on integers, and provides a test suite with mocha and chai.

Estimated time to complete: `60 minutes`

You will be guided to use a cloud-based development environment using Visual Studio Code and GitHub Codespaces, and then use it to enhance a simple Node Calculator app. You will also use GitHub Copilot to write some missing unit tests for the Calculator app.
