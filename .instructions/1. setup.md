## Instructions for launching Codespaces

To complete the workshop, you will need an environment with GitHub Copilot, and a supported IDE such as Visual Studio Code. You will use GitHub Codespaces to launch a pre-configured environment. By utilizing this fully working dev environment from Codespaces, you can quickly begin on unknown codebases, reducing friction and increasing efficiency.

You can find out more about GitHub Codespaces [here](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
